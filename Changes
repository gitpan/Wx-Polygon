0.06 - Wrong name in the license (Mattie Barbon). Used
       example code from a project of his.

0.05 - Test script: Changed refresh from
       whole window to only the Panel
       used for the drawing.

0.04 - Test script was not in MANIFEST.
     - Making on Win32 was not as simple as expected.

0.03 Changed the calculations from Perl to C to get a 
     performance boost. This makes us dependent on wxMakeMaker.

0.02 Planar prerequisite is no longer.
